            <p>
              We introduce Self Forcing, a novel training paradigm for autoregressive video diffusion models. It addresses the longstanding issue of exposure bias, where models trained on ground-truth context must generate sequences conditioned on their own imperfect outputs during inference. Unlike prior methods that denoise future frames based on ground-truth context frames, Self Forcing conditions each frame's generation on previously self-generated outputs by performing autoregressive rollout with key-value(KV) caching during training. This strategy enables supervision through a holistic loss at the video level that directly evaluates the quality of the entire generated sequence, rather than relying solely on traditional frame-wise objectives. To ensure training efficiency, we employ a few-step diffusion model along with a stochastic gradient truncation strategy, effectively balancing computational cost and performance. We further introduce a rolling KV cache mechanism that enables efficient autoregressive video extrapolation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time streaming video generation with sub-second latency on a single GPU, while matching or even surpassing the generation quality of significantly slower and non-causal diffusion models.

        We show that naively performing rolling KV cache to generate long videos leads to flickering artifacts, which can be addressed by performing local attention training.

    <div class="content has-text-justified" style="font-size: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      <p>
        While Self Forcing addresses exposure bias and we observe no error accumulation within the video length the model is trained on (5 seocnds), we still observe quality degradation when extrapolating beyond its training horizon. Below we show 30-second videos generated via sliding window extrapolation.
